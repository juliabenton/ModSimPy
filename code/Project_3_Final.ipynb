    "# Question\n",
    "For our project, we researched the forces that act on a fired projectile and a free-falling object to answer the design question: What is the optimal angle from the ground that a shooter should fire a bullet at a falling clay pigeon while playing the new game of pigeon ball? Inspired by both clay pigeon shooting and skeet shooting, pigeon ball is Talia and Julia's creation that involves a shooter firing a shotgun across the length of a football field at a clay pigeon being dropped straight down from the top of a football goal post. \n",
    "\n",
    "In our model, we wanted to know what the optimal angle someone playing pigeon ball should shoot a shotgun at so that the bullet and clay pigeon would reach the same (x,y) position and the clay pigeon would break. We gave the bullet fired from the gun a given initial velocity vector. The pigeon was dropped with an initial velocity of 0 m/s in the y-direction that increased during the drop, and a velocity of 0 m/s in the x-direction that stayed constant throughout the fall. We implemented net force physics equations for this translational motion model, considering the drag force and gravitational force acting on both the bullet and pigeon. We modelled the parabolic motion of the projectile bullet and the free fall of the pigeon. We decided to not include terminal velocity of either object in our model. We used Cartesian coordinates and defined our origin of (0,0) to be the point on the field where the shooter's feet are. The clay pigeon drops at the same instant the gun fires. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our model and question are important because they can help skeet shooter and hunters aim accurately at a free-falling pigeon or target object. "

When the y-position distance between the objects is positive, we know that the angle is too small and the bullet travels over the pigeon. When the distance is negative, the bullet has traveled under the pigeon without colliding because the angle is too big. We are interested in the point at which the difference is zero and the pigeon and the bullet have the same exact (x,y) position."

    "This model used a SweepSeries to determine the optimal angle to fire a shotgun to hit a clay pigeon that is falling from a football field goal post from the other side of the field.\n",
    "\n",
    "We answered our design question (what is the optimal angle from the ground that a shooter should fire a bullet at a falling clay pigeon while playing the new game of pigeon ball?) by finding that the optimal angle is 5.58 degrees. While this angle seems small and low to the ground, it makes sense due to the very high speed at which the bullet is traveling across the field after being shot.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our first figure, we show how the difference in y-position  between the pigeon and the bullet change as a function of the launch angle. The line crosses 0 on the y-axis between 0 and 10 degrees, indicating our optimal angle would be somewhere in between. The second figure depicts the trajectory of the pigeon and the bullet when the optimal angle is placed into params. We can see that the two object collide 6.137 meters above the ground."

    "Iteration played an important role in our model. We originally made a model that involved a stationary apple in a tree while the gun fired so that we could start simple and only model the forces on the bullet’s travel before introducing a second moving object. Making a basic working model and then introducing new factors to answer our question was a very successful strategy and prevented us from being daunted by the task of modeling the independent movement of two objects until they collided. \n",
    "We also learned the value of testing each function as we created it when we got complicated errors and needed to retrace our steps and see what function wasn’t working correctly. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our model and question involving pigeon ball are valuable because skeet shooter and hunters will know at what angle to aim to accurately hit a free-falling pigeon or other target object. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our model worked quite well, but it could have been made even better by incorporating terminal velocity. Including the universal gravitational attraction between the bullet and pigeon would likely have no effect on the system since these forces are so small but are real-world forces. Including these force if we had more time to improve our program might have made our model more accurately reflect the physical world although not significantly change our results.\n"
